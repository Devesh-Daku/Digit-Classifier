## Project Strategy
The project was executed in a structured, multi-phase workflow, progressing from foundational analysis to advanced model tuning.

* **Phase 1: Foundation & Exploration:** Initial setup, data loading, and a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
* **Phase 2: Data Preprocessing:** Transformation of the raw data into a clean, normalized, and correctly shaped format suitable for training a CNN.
* **Phase 3: Baseline Modeling (LeNet-5):** Implementation of a classic LeNet-5 inspired architecture to establish a solid performance benchmark.
* **Phase 4: Advanced Modeling (VGG-style CNN):** Development of a deeper, more powerful VGG-style CNN with modern regularization techniques to surpass the baseline.
* **Phase 5: Model Tuning with Data Augmentation:** Experimentation with data augmentation to test its effectiveness in improving the advanced model's generalization.
* **Phase 6: Conclusion & Future Work:** A final summary of findings, comparison of all models, and discussion of potential future improvements.

## Final Conclusion
Our most successful model was the **VGG-style CNN without data augmentation**. This advanced architecture proved to be the "sweet spot," providing enough complexity to thoroughly learn the features of the MNIST dataset without significant overfitting. The final score of **0.99471** and a global rank of **134** is an outstanding achievement.

This project successfully demonstrates a robust, end-to-end machine learning process‚Äîfrom data analysis and preprocessing to iterative modeling and submission‚Äîand highlights the importance of experimentation to find the optimal solution.
